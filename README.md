Taylor Swift has a ton a Youtube Views and a couple cute cats. Time to sort!

T-Swift's favorite number is 13 so I researched her top 13 most viewed official music videos from YouTube. Views were recorded from the site on January 17, 2015. The idea of the site is to sort Taylor's Top 13 Videos by views, using sorting algorithims. I chose to use insertion sort in this case. I wanted to visualize insertion sort using the list of music videos. 

Insertion sort goes one item at a time from the list of data, finds where it belongs within what's already been sorted, and inserts it there. This process continues until all the items have been sorted.

I included a "shuffle" button as well so that the list could be shuffled and then resorted as many times as needed.

I collaborated with classmates, teachers, and TAs. I also used the internet, especially the provided sorting algorithm sites, wikipedia, youTube, and google (to find cute cat pics). I used jQuery UI to make the cats draggable.
